  ABSTRACT = {Agriculture is undergoing a new technology revolution supported by policy-makers around the world. While smart technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, robotics, and the Internet of Things, could play an important role in achieving enhanced productivity and greater eco-efficiency, critics have suggested that the consideration of social implications is being side-lined. Research illustrates that some agricultural practitioners are concerned about using certain smart technologies. Indeed, some studies argue that agricultural societies may be changed, or “re-scripted,” in undesirable ways, and there is precedent to suggest that wider society may be concerned about radical new agricultural technologies. We therefore encourage policy-makers, funders, technology companies, and researchers to consider the views of both farming communities and wider society. In agriculture, the concept of responsible innovation has not been widely considered, although two recent papers have made useful suggestions. We build on these interventions by arguing that key dimensions of responsible innovation—anticipation, inclusion, reflexivity, and responsiveness—should be applied to this fourth agricultural revolution. We argue, however, that ideas of responsible innovation should be further developed in order to make them relevant and robust for emergent agri-tech, and that frameworks should be tested in practice to see if they can actively shape innovation trajectories. In making suggestions on how to construct a more comprehensive framework for responsible innovation in sustainable agriculture, we call for: (i) a more systemic approach that maps and attends to the wider ecology of innovations associated with this fourth agricultural revolution; (ii) a broadening of notions of “inclusion” in responsible innovation to account better for diverse and already existing spaces of participation in agri-tech, and (iii) greater testing of frameworks in practice to see if they are capable of making innovation processes more socially responsible.}

  abstract = "Undoubtedly, high demands for food from the world-wide growing population are impacting the environment and putting many pressures on agricultural productivity. Agriculture 4.0, as the fourth evolution in the farming technology, puts forward four essential requirements: increasing productivity, allocating resources reasonably, adapting to climate change, and avoiding food waste. As advanced information systems and Internet technologies are adopted in Agriculture 4.0, enormous farming data, such as meteorological information, soil conditions, marketing demands, and land uses, can be collected, analyzed, and processed for assisting farmers in making appropriate decisions and obtaining higher profits. Therefore, agricultural decision support systems for Agriculture 4.0 has become a very attractive topic for the research community. The objective of this paper aims at exploring the upcoming challenges of employing agricultural decision support systems in Agriculture 4.0. Future researchers may improve the decision support systems by overcoming these detected challenges. In this paper, the systematic literature review technique is used to survey thirteen representative decision support systems, including their applications for agricultural mission planning, water resources management, climate change adaptation, and food waste control. Each decision support system is analyzed under a systematic manner. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted from the aspects of interoperability, scalability, accessibility, usability, etc. Based on the evaluation result, upcoming challenges are detected and summarized, suggesting the development trends and demonstrating potential improvements for future research."

  abstract = "Decision Support Systems (DSSs) are used in precision agriculture to provide feedback to a variety of stakeholders, including farmers, advisers, researchers and policymakers. However, increments in the amount of data might lead to data quality issues, and as these applications scale into big, real-time monitoring systems the problem gets even more challenging. Visualisation is a powerful technique used in these systems that provides an indispensable step in assisting end-users to understand and interpret the data. In this paper, we present a systematic review to synthesise literature related to the use of visualisation techniques in the domain of agriculture. The search identified 61 eligible articles, from which we established end-users, visualisation techniques and data collection methods across different application domains. We found visualisation techniques used in various areas of agriculture, including viticulture, dairy farming, wheat production and irrigation management. Our results show that the majority of DSSs utilise maps, together with satellite imagery, as the central visualisation. Also, we observed that there is an excellent opportunity for dashboards to enable end-users with better interaction support to understand the uncertainty of data. Based on this analysis, we provide design guidelines towards the implementation of more interactive and visual DSSs."

However, most of these tools fail to find use or fall out of use extremely quickly. In the aim of aiding in the conception and development of practical and successful decision support systems, i.e. systems that can lead to positive outcomes, this review looks over the existing literature, both EDSS-centric and from broader decision-related fields, to highlight some of the most important challenges influencing the success and usability of these systems. In all, 13 major challenges facing EDSS development were identified and over 60 recommendations and best practices were provided to address these challenges. Though this paper is mainly focused on environmental decision support systems, most of the highlighted information and conclusions are applicable to the development of decision support systems in any field."

The emerging technologies are making the precision agriculture omnipresent and allow potential for enriching it with computer-assisted decision support systems for farm management. In this paper we describe a novel system AgroDSS that bridges the gap between agricultural systems and state-of-the-art decision support methodology. The described system is intended for integration into the existing farm management information systems and provides a cloud-based decision support toolbox, allowing farmers to upload their own data, utilize several data analysis methods and retrieve their outputs. The implemented tools include predictive modeling with explanation, accuracy evaluation, time series clustering and decomposition, and structural change detection. They can help users make predictions for simulated scenarios and better understand the dependencies (interactions) within their domain. We apply the AgroDSS system on a case study of pest population dynamics, illustrating the potential for its use."

  abstract = "Precision agriculture is an important part of the sustainable intensification of agriculture, where information and communications technology and other technologies are necessary, but not sufficient for sustainable farming systems. The technology must fit into farmers' practice and be handled by their experienced-based, situated knowledge in order to contribute to increased sustainability in their farming. This study analysed the relationship between farmers' experience-based situated knowledge and the use of agricultural decision support systems in order to develop care by farmers in their practice. The theoretical framework of distributed cognition was used as a lens when investigating and analysing farmers' use of an agricultural decision support system called CropSAT developed for calculation of variable rate application files for nitrogen fertilisation from satellite images. In the case study, the unit of analysis was broadened to the whole socio-technical system of farmers' decision-making and learning, including other people and different kinds of tools and artefacts. The results revealed that social contexts could support farmers' development of cognitive strategies for use of agricultural decision support systems, e.g. CropSAT, and could thus facilitate decision-making and learning through development of enhanced professional vision that hopefully may increase farmers' situated knowledge and care in PA."
